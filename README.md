Pleasure to meet you virtually. I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with experience in JavaScript, Typescript, Node.js, React, Next.js, DBs and Web3. I'm always exploring and chasing the excitement of learning new technologies. When I'm not coding, I enjoy gaming, hardware, space and science.

> ðŸ’¡ [Take everything into consideration.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_(slogan))
>
> The "THINK" slogan was first used by Thomas J. Watson in December 1911, while managing the sales and advertising departments at the National Cash Register Company. At an uninspiring sales meeting, Watson interrupted, saying "The trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough. We don't get paid for working with our feet â€” we get paid for working with our heads". Watson then wrote THINK on the easel.
> 
> Asked later what he meant by the slogan, Watson replied, "By THINK I mean take everything into consideration. I refuse to make the sign more specific. If a man just sees THINK, he'll find out what I mean. We're not interested in a logic course."
